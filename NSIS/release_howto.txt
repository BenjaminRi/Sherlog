- Increase crate version, build project again (also add Cargo.lock) and commit in git repo
- Disable Windows console in main.rs
- Set sfile password environment variable and recompile (trigger sfile.rs recompile if necessary - new rust compilers recognize the change and do incremental builds correctly)
- Run NSIS to create a release installer
- Test installer, in particular, remove C:\msys64\mingw64\bin from the PATH variable and make sure that the program finds all its dynamic libraries and runs properly
- Update release notes
